# hiruyasumi-games

Small games made for the fun of making things. The time limit for developing each game is 55 minutes, with 5 minutes for repository cleanup. Only non-functional changes are allowed post-development.

0415-spiral got a lot of minor updates over the course of three days' worth of public transport, though. Check it out here:

Honorable mention to 1026-colorwaves:

Out of the actual games, 1024-lightsphere definitely turned out the best (remember, only 55 minutes for dev):

Have fun! I might make more in the future.
